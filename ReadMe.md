# üê∏ Bioacoustic CNN Classifier
### Automatic Classification of Anuran Family Calls Using Convolutional Neural Networks

---

## üìò Project Overview
This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify frog calls into their respective anuran families using pre-processed bioacoustic features.  
The model is trained and evaluated on publicly available feature datasets (e.g., MFCCs).

**Workflow**
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- CNN definition with TensorFlow / Keras  
- Training and validation  
- Evaluation and visualization  
- Saving the trained model for later inference
